Hello !!!

This is a project that I did it by following

https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23595192?start=225#overview

This is a purely project-based course. It is geared toward beginners, but intermediate developers can also enjoy creating new things. This course includes 50 mini projects in HTML, CSS & JavaScript that relate to the DOM (Document Object Model)
